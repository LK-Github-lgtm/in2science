<h1>Data Plotting and Analysis on my In2Science Placement</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, we were taught how to interpret data and turn it into a graph using code.</p>
<p>We were given demographic data taken from a real-life study - age, sex, height, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study was measuring memory function in adults over 50 using the MRI.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this data, we would find the links between one factor and another, to see if they correlated, by producing a graph representing the data.</p>
<h2>Data plotting and statistics</h2>
<p>We wanted to find out the relationships between different factors that had been measured, such as lesion volume and lesion number, and produce the results in a graph.</p>
<p>We used R and ChatGPT to analyse the data. ChatGPT provided us with the code we needed simply by giving it a few instructions. R enabled us to run that code.</p>
<p>For example, we produced a plot to find the correlation between lesion number and BMI.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Plots the age against the number of lesions in each participant.
# The results show that as age increases, lesion number increases.

# Create the plot
ggplot(participant_data, aes(x = age, y = lesion_number)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = lesion_number), size = 5, alpha = 0.7) + # Points with color and size mappings
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;, linetype = &quot;solid&quot;) + # Add regression line
  scale_color_gradient(low = &quot;lightblue&quot;, high = &quot;darkblue&quot;) +      # Color gradient for lesion_number
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 6)) +                         # Size gradient for age
  labs(title = &quot;Correlation between Age and Lesion Number&quot;,
       x = &quot;Age (years)&quot;,                                         # X-axis label
       y = &quot;Lesion Number&quot;,                                       # Y-axis label
       caption = &quot;Data Source: Your Dataset&quot;) +                   # Add a caption for the data source
  theme_light(base_size = 14) +                                   # Light theme with larger base font size
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = 16), # Center and bold the title with a larger size
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10), size = 14),  # Add margin and size to x-axis title
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10), size = 14),  # Add margin and size to y-axis title
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),                           # Size of axis text
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;gray90&quot;, size = 0.5), # Light major grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = &quot;gray95&quot;, size = 0.2)  # Light minor grid lines
  )

<h2>BMI and Lesion Number</h2>
<p>We wanted to see if there was a relatiionship between lesion number and BMI and so we plotted a graph to show the correlation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">ggplot(participant_data, aes(x = bmi, y = lesion_number)) +
  geom_point(color = &quot;darkblue&quot;, size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +   # Adjust point color, size, and transparency
  labs(title = &quot;Relationship between BMI and Lesion Number&quot;,
       x = &quot;BMI&quot;,
       y = &quot;Lesion Number&quot;) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +                            # Use a minimal theme with larger base font size
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = &quot;bold&quot;),   # Center the plot title and make it bold
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),    # Add margin to the x-axis title
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),    # Add margin to the y-axis title
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;gray80&quot;),       # Lighten the grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = &quot;gray90&quot;)        # Lighten the minor grid lines
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;, se = FALSE, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) # Add a regression line

<h2>Graphs to show the height, age and weight in participants</h2>
<p>We wanted to compare the participants height, age and weight to see if there was a correlation between the three.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Create each plot separately
height_plot &lt;- ggplot(participant_data, aes(x = height)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.01, fill = &quot;blue&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 1) +
  labs(title = &quot;Histogram of Height&quot;, x = &quot;Height&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) +
  theme_minimal()

weight_plot &lt;- ggplot(participant_data, aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;green&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 1) +
  labs(title = &quot;Histogram of Weight&quot;, x = &quot;Weight&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) +
  theme_minimal()

age_plot &lt;- ggplot(participant_data, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;red&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 1) +
  labs(title = &quot;Histogram of Age&quot;, x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) +
  theme_minimal()

# Combine the plots side by side
grid.arrange(height_plot, weight_plot, age_plot, ncol = 3)

<h2>Calculating the p and r value</h2>
<p>To see if the results we found were significant, we decided to run a statistical test.</p>
<h3>Calculate p-value using correlation test on filtered data</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>cor_test &lt;- cor.test(participant_data$age, participant_data$lesion_number)
p_value_cor &lt;- cor_test$p.value</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Print the results</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>cat(&quot;P-value from correlation test (lesion_number ≤ 20):&quot;, p_value_cor, &quot;\n&quot;)
cat(&quot;R-squared value:&quot;, r_squared, &quot;\n&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are the results for age vs lesion number:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cat(&quot;P-value from correlation test (lesion_number ≤ 20):&quot;, p_value_cor, &quot;\n&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P-value from correlation test (lesion_number ≤ 20): 0.0008118473</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cat(&quot;R-squared value:&quot;, r_squared, &quot;\n&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>R-squared value: 0.2026725</p>
